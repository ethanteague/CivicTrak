Dear NLC Research Team,

I've developed a comprehensive compliance guide specifically for municipal websites that addresses the growing legal and technical requirements cities face.

Given the 300% increase in ADA lawsuits against municipalities from 2020-2024, this resource provides practical guidance on:
- ADA & Section 508 compliance

- Cybersecurity best practices
- Implementation checklists

The guide is designed specifically for city officials and IT managers. I'd be honored to contribute this resource to NLC's knowledge base for your member cities.

Dear Government Technology Editorial Team,

I'd like to pitch a guest article on municipal website compliance requirements for 2025, focusing on the legal and technical challenges cities face.

Article angle: "The Hidden Costs of Non-Compliant Municipal Websites: A 2025 Compliance Guide"

Key points:
- 300% increase in ADA lawsuits against cities

- Cybersecurity mandates and incident response
- Real compliance costs vs. prevention

I've already created a comprehensive compliance guide that could serve as the foundation for this article. As someone who works directly with municipal websites, I can provide practical insights your readers need.
